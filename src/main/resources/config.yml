# ChopTree 2
# ReWritten by ellbristow
#
# Configuration File
#
# ActiveByDefault: Do new players given choptree.chop 'POP' trees by default?
#
# UseAnything: Can a player use anything to 'POP' trees (rather than just an axe)?
#
# AllowedTools: If UseAnything is false, what tools can be used (separated with commas, NO SPACES)?
#
# MoreDamageToTools: Do tools take the amount of damage they WOULD if they chopped the whole tree?
#
# InterruptIfToolBreaks: If the tool does not have enough durability to 'POP' the whole tree, should the 'POP' be stopped?
#
# LogsMoveDown: Are all item drops dropped by the chopped log (rather than by each 'POP'ed log)?
#
# OnlyTrees: Does the 'POP' only work if the player chopped a tree (rather than ANY pile of logs)?
#
# PopLeaves: Leaves are 'POP'ed when the tree 'POP's
#
# MatchLogType: Only logs and leaves that match the log type of the first log broken will pop
#
# LeafRadius: How far out should leaves be popped from each log block
